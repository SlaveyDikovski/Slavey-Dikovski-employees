# How to start

This is an application that takes a .CSV file with data about projects. 

After the file has been selected, the app displays the team of two employees that have worked together the most and what projects they have worked on.

To start the application, you first need to clone this repository.

The next step is going into the folder and installing all node modules with the command ```npm i```

After the modules have been installed, you need to run the command ```npm start``` to start the application.
